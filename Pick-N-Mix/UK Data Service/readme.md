The UK Data Service holds the UKâ€™s largest collection of research data. This introductory webinar is for anyone with an interest in social research who wants to hear about the vast array of resources we offer. 

Participants will learn about the different types of quantitative and qualitative data we hold, how to find those data collections using our online resource discovery tools, and how to register to access datasets in various formats. 

We will also demonstrate how some of our data collections can be viewed and analysed online, as well as providing an overview of our support and training resources for students, researchers and teachers.
