Julia Kasmire  
Hi, thanks for joining everyone. As he said, my name is Dr. Julia kazmaier. And I am very pleased that you've come along to learn a bit about the UK data service, what we do and what we can help you do. This introductory webinar is really for anyone who has an interest in social or economic research data and wants to hear more about the resources that we offer and the services we provide, including downloadable training sets, or sorry, downloadable data sets, training, different kinds of you know, support functions. Also look demonstrated some of the different major types of data that we hold and how you can register for the service and download them. It's all free. So you know, that's a bonus. And, yeah, I have a presentation and then there's time at the end for questions. So if you want To throw questions into the question box, at any point, feel free to do so. I'll go through them at the end and answer. And we can probably take ourselves off of mute at that point and just have a conversation, but it helps to have the questions written down as they occur to you. So just to be clear, see, can you hear me? I'm going to assume you can, because that seems a reasonable assumption.

Julia Kasmire  
So just a quick overview. And I want to say a little bit about who we are the EU, the UK data services, what kind of data we hold, and what kind of types does it fall into? Our different online resources are how you can get some more help outside of this introductory webinar, and then we'll have time for questions. So it seems like a really obvious question to start off with what is the UK data service? Well, that's our logo and but you know, slightly more informative is to say that we're are a comprehensive resource funded by the Let me check to say I'm doing this properly Economic and Social Research Council. And we aim to be a single sort of portal into lots of different kinds of data that lots of different kinds of researchers might want access to. The the higher up organisation that we belong to is the UK Data Archive, and they do a lot of wider data services, but but we're sort of the public freely accessible side of that. We also offer support, training guidance, and you know, events, like this event could have been an in person event where it not for pandemics. So this is what our website looks like, although it changes pretty quickly because we have a lot of sort of updated stuff constantly. That's the web address and In case it wasn't obvious, I mean, if you search put UK data service into a search engine, that's what you're going to get. And, and across the top, these are sort of the main headings that you'll probably want to look at. So you know, how to get data, how to use data, how to deposit data, you have some some data that you think people want to be able to have a rummage through. And then news and events, which is where I usually work in events. There is a search bar. But probably that will come more of use to you after you see a presentation like this or have a look around at the different kinds of data we hold because right now, if you just put something in the search bar, it'll be a little bit hard to interpret what you get. Also, there's a contact a new user guides and you know, frequently asked questions and all that kind of thing. But hopefully this presentation will answer a lot of those questions for you anyway. So Who is it for? Well, obviously academics researchers and students, but a lot of government departments use it charities and foundations, business consultants, some business people as well just purely for their own interest. independent research centres think tanks, actually quite a lot of people also just people who are a bit bored or nosy. So we, we have around 23,000 users and they are actually spread around the globe, although most of them are in the UK. And those 23,000 users download about 60,000 data downloads every year. So so we're fairly popular. And what is data is a bit of an abstract question. There's a lot of ways you could answer it. So you can see facts and statistics collected for analysis is obviously one way to interpret data. It's also you can think each individual piece of information is data and then Typically the kind of data we work with is numeric. So crime rates, unemployment rates, literacy rates, you know, risks and probabilities, things like this. But it's also non numeric information. We do a lot with surveys, administrative records, business records, census responses, a lot of things that are not purely numeric. And obviously, if you're attending an event held by open data, Manchester, you're probably like, great, I understand what data is just give me the data already. So here's this part for you. How do you get data? Well, there's a lot of ways you can do your own data collection, which is potentially exactly the right data you need, but it can be expensive and difficult and perhaps not realistic. You know, it's, it's not that easy to get 40,000 households to participate in a survey. So this is where we come in. secondary data analysis does not usually cost you anything, because we're given all of our data away for free. There's a lot of different kinds of data. And we have the data that we present, we also do an analysis on to show whether it's representative and how representative it is. It's robust, it's transparent. The only downside to secondary data is that it may not be exactly targeted to your needs. But hopefully using more than one data set, you might be able to sort of triangulate and get exactly what you need, without having to collect it yourself, which is always a bonus. But in practical terms, you get data by going to our home, our website and clicking get data. Because Yeah, that's that's what it is. You want data we got that. So you can use the search bar as I said. And there's also once you know about these different categories of data There's a quick access bar. So you know, if you want census data, you can go there if you know you want international macro data you go there. So what I'm going to do now is sort of walk through these different kinds of data so that you know, what it is you're interested in and what it looks like and how you access it. Also, a lot of people find it very useful to look at the variable and question bank, because they they won't necessarily know which survey asks questions about energy use, for example, or whether the census includes things about you know, how many members of a household are retired or in work or whether they work part time you might think is that a survey or census data? No, go to the variable loan question bank because it will tell you which surveys ask which questions and, of course, the FAQ because we get a lot of people asking the same cues. So just to Be very clear, we do not collect data ourselves. We provide data that other people have collected. But we do see our role to curate preserve and catalogue the data collected by others and to make them available to you under the UK data source licence. So what are our sources? We got a lot of them. We got a lot of sources. So we've got Office for National Statistics Centre for longitudinal study, the World Bank, the home office, DWP, International Monetary Funds, they come from governments, they come from international organisations, research institutes, and individual researchers. So if you or someone you know, has a data set that you want us to hold and sort of make available, yeah, you can you can deposit your data with us more than happy. Yeah, sorry. So we have lots of different sources, but what do we have? So there's four key times PCE survey micro data, international macro data, census and qualitative mixed methods. And I'll go through each of these and talk about sort of what the sub categories are and what they look like and how big they are and things like that these kinds of typical questions. So, first question is what is micro versus macro? Because often they come from the same source, and it's about how the data is treated before it's given to you. So micro data is individual level data usually collected from individuals or sometimes households, through surveys, and it asks questions about the individual. So you know, things like, what is someone's age and occupation? What are their exercise habits, what are their smoking habits, and it might try and use that data to identify what their risk factors are for certain health conditions. For example, there are lots of other options. kinds of micro data, whereas macro data is aggregate data. And it is aggregated data of all of those individual questions like do you smoke or do you not, but presented at much higher regional, or sort of geographic levels? And this is useful for comparing two geographic levels, you know, what, how many people smoke in Manchester versus in London or something like that. But it's also for comparing geographic regions over time. So how many people in Manchester smoke now versus 10 years ago or 20 years ago? Usually, macro data is created from micro data sources. So all of the individual surveys about do you smoke, or do you ride a bike, you know, aggregate that together you got macro data. So a little bit more about survey micro data, let's just dive in. It's usually individual, a household level, and it has been anonymized to prevent disclosure. That is important because you Yeah, people's privacy and and anonymity is an important thing. The survey micro data we hold is typically very large sample sizes. And they're they're checked to be sure that in the anonymization process, they're still large, but they are nationally representative. And of course, like any kind of data, you need to analyse it using SPSS or Stata or something like that. But because this data is so wide ranging and so large, and so representative, it's very flexible. You can create your own tables with with populations or subpopulations, attributes that are interesting to you can can really look at identifying the relationships that you're keen to explore. So here's just an example of a screenshot of what you know, a survey micro data data set might look like. This is from the British Social Attitudes Survey in 2009. And it shows in the rows there are people so each row is a person. But they of course been anonymized. So they just have a row label and in the columns of the variables, based on the answers asked so for example, you know, has their sex is either one or two and their age at the time of the survey and, you know, their rating of how they far they consider they travelled to work, whatever these sort of social attitudes were questioning. So, yeah, people in the rows, variables in the columns. And if you were to analyse it in, I believe this was done in SPSS, which is not my favourite tool, I prefer R, but that's a question for another day. So here's a cross tabulation of body mass index by age group from the 2014 Health Survey for England. So showing sort of what proportion of individuals fall into different body BMI categories. So, you know, for example, this is the kind of thing that lots of people might be interested in knowing to compare regions or compare one region over time. And of course, you know, you can create graphs, here's gross weekly pay from someone's main job broken down by sex. And you can see that it has been changing over the, you know, past the 10 years that this was captured. But unfortunately, there is still a clear difference between the men and the women. So So cross sectional surveys are a little different. These are often repeated annually, but some are done quarterly. And each time they interview different people, so they they offer a sort of randomised snapshot at a specific point in time, and they tend to cover sort of the main economic and social reasons Question. So health and crime and social attitudes and living costs. They often use the exact same questions as previous surveys so that you can really compare one survey to the one done the following year. Although they do drop questions that are really no longer relevant, and they'll add new questions so that they're roughly about the same size, but they they try hard to keep them the same and relevant, which is a bit of a contrary sort of cross purposes. But what can they do? So here's some some of the most popular cross sectional surveys we get the labour force survey asking people how much how many hours they work, what they earn, and what kind of occupations they have, what rank they are lots of things like that. And you will Population Survey family expenditure, sort of poverty indicators, health surveys, crime, Family Resources, British Social Attitudes Survey, that's a fairly new one. You know, there's Some of these be going for quite a long time the labour force surveys since 1975, and some are more recent. So yeah, as I said labour force survey since 75 became quarterly in 1991. So it's really fine tuning how much we know about how much people work and what kind of industries they work in, and, you know, lots of very useful information. And they use international definitions of employment, unemployment and economic connectivity. So it isn't dependent on which political parties in power, or what part of the country you're in an unemployment, unemployment, all universally defined. And this survey, for example, is really, really well relied on lots of different policies address the information that it brings up and they they really work to To sort of deal with the kind of patterns that it displays, covers things like occupation and training and work and also the household characteristics of economically active individuals. So, for example, this is the kind of analysis that came out of the labour force survey, this shows the sort of sector breakdown or like, what kind of where people come from when they become teachers, or where they go when they stop being teachers assuming that they do not come directly from students and do not go directly to retired. So it's if someone comes into work as teacher from another work or leaves work as teachers, so you get these kind of patterns showing that you know, whether they come in from private schools or go to private schools, you know, the flow is not equal. It's an interesting kind of pattern. And if that's the kind of topic you're looking at, this is the kind of survey for you longitudinal data Which is broken into both panel and cohort data is similar to cross sectional surveys in that it's individual level. It's large samples, it's nationally representative, and that they're repeated typically annually. But unlike cross sectional surveys, they ask this questions to the same people every time. So this builds up a different kind of a picture instead of a random snapshot. It's really tracking, personal change. And this this really shows how events link to pardon me to other events in time. It's really interesting stuff. So understanding society, for example, is one of our most popular sort of panels. longitudinal data sets is also called the UK household longitudinal study, which is a mouthful, but it's a it's a panel study of 40,000 households, 100,000 individuals. It is representative of that There's a subsection as well to get an ethnic minority boosts so that all the different sort of ethnic minorities, they get a clear picture of that. And then it covers a lot of things that you might expect in a survey called understanding society. So it's about employment and earnings and benefits, networks, religions and finance and environment. Yeah. It also includes some biomarkers. And it comes with consents to link to administrative data for health and education. So it's really useful, well formed set of data is great. And cohort studies are different instead of being the same households, for example, all the people in the same household. It's everyone who shares a particular characteristic. So birth cohorts. They sort of pick everyone who was born in a particular week in a particular year and they track those people. So in this way, it shows her The difference between generations. So for example, there was in 1958, there's a cohort established in 1958. And they ran the surveys when those individuals were 711 1623, so on. There's one other one in 1970 and another one in 2000. And, obviously, in this one instead of being the same questions to the same people, they're age appropriate questions to the same people. So you know, oh, sounds like just chain.

Sam  
We seem to last you for a second there Julia. 

Julia Kasmire  
Yeah. Am I back? 

Sam  
You're back. 

Julia Kasmire  
Okay. And you can still see my screen. Cuz I can still see your screen. 

Sam  
Yes. 

Julia Kasmire  
Okay, great. Yeah, I've no idea why but zoom occasionally just decides to switch me around to the sort of mic Phone and camera that are built into my laptop, which are no good. Sorry, I'll carry on. So cohorts are different kind of longitudinal study, also very useful. These ones are better at showing the difference between generations. So obviously, the Millennium cohort study is capturing the millennials. Yeah, so here's an example of an analysis done using the the cohort studies jaws on a million observations that came from almost 20,000 individuals. And so in this case, it sort of tracks childhood stress and, you know, sort of how unemployment and stress over different time periods and age and you can see sort of maybe how political events line up with peaks in stress. And, you know, that's an interesting thing. It's the kind of thing you can do with a cohort study. So just to be a little bit clear about the difference between panel and cohort because they're both longitudinal studies. They use some different terminology. So panels go in waves and cohorts go and sweeps panels sent samples are sort of randomly chosen, whereas cohorts they share an event. panels happen once a year, typically cohorts, you know, they sorry, panel studies tend to run for several years, you know, maybe 2030 years, whereas cohorts are trying to be their whole life. They, panel studies happen frequently, cohorts less frequently, the questions and panels try to remain the same as the cohorts are targeted to the context. And, you know, panels are trying to show change. Individuals change over time, whereas cohorts are more about change between generations. So, just a little difference there. There are so many kinds of surveys you wouldn't believe cross national surveys, like they sound are pretty much the same questions asked to people in in different countries, so they are quite standardised and you know they cover the basic topics you would expect. But they are designed to show international comparisons. So let's get on to macro data. This is time series data aggregated to country or regional levels. They are regularly updated. These are provided by you know, the IMF and the OECD, the World Bank really big people, they do a lot. These are restricted to staff and students from UK institutions. All over the world bank bank data are open access. So if you register for the UK data service with a email address associated with a UK higher education institution, you can get access to all of this. Otherwise, I think you have to register and then specifically apply for an exemption to the restriction Yeah, there's a few things like that that are been restricted, but the World Bank ones free to anyone. So as you might expect international macro data cover a lot of economic performance and trade and employment, education, science and technology, you know that these kinds of international demography issues, migration is a big one. And you get to these still through the UK data service site. And then yeah, just sort of on the side there, you can choose which source you want your data to come from. There's, you know, you can choose from over here, there's example query. So if you've never done this before, you can see what other people have asked and you can sort of copy them. There are guides so these breakdown, how to get the data you want. And this is an example of a chart that someone just created using this kind of Data says when showing the person

Sam  
oh it's done again there Julia

Julia Kasmire  
No idea why it does this.

Sam  
That's okay. You're back 

Julia Kasmire  
Technology. 

Sam  
Yeah. No worries.

Julia Kasmire  
 Okay. So, yeah, you can you can show for example, how some countries are, you know, ageing much quick really quickly really kind of alarmingly fast whereas others you know the sweep upwards in ageing is is delayed or it's happening slower. So see, get here we go census data everyone knows about the census if you don't, where have you been hiding? So the census has been running since I think 18 61 or something, but we offer since 1971. So it happens every 10 years. And it really aims to ask these this set of survey questions to every single person in the country. Obviously, not all of them comply, but it is considered the gold standard because it really tries to get them off. And it's sort of the baseline for what other statistics are compared to. So that's how we judge how representative other kinds of surveys are. And it has detailed combinations characteristics, breaks them down to quite small geography. So you get very specific, and it includes aggregate data, boundary data flow data and micro data. So we've covered micro data, it's basically these kind of individual surveys. And aggregate data is sort of the averages or the the cumulative totals for the answers to those surveys at geography levels, but we'll cover bands inflow. So the census asks about a lot of different kinds of topics. And the most recent additions to that have been national identity, second homes and intention to stay in the country. So you can see that these are now questions that the nation is more concerned with asking with winnowing about than they used to, you know, I think the first survey, the first census was sort of like age and occupation, and how many children you had or something it was really basic. So it's, it's come on a lot. And the aggregate data, of course, is the accounts of people households and particular combinations of characteristics for an area. And that can be from very small, I think the smallest called like super output areas or something like that the smallest one, and they can be as small as 40 households and 100 people are, the more Typically they're about 125 households. So it's approximately the Maybe a postcode, something like that. So you can find out, for example, the number of people who are aged over 50 and unemployed within each of the wards in the district to Greater Manchester. That's the kind of detail and combination of chemistry characteristics that can get you to a very pinpointed sort of set of data like that. And if you want to get census data, which is is free, this one's completely free. You can go to Cass web, if you want UK wide aggregate data 471 8191 in 2001 or infuse if you want sort of a slightly different level of detail of English and Welsh aggregate data for 2001 and 2011. So we if you want Northern Ireland or Scotland data for 2011 you have to go directly to the Irish or Scottish sort of statistics boards, they haven't deposited their data with us at least they haven't yet they may still, who knows. So if you go to infuse, for example, if you want the 2011 census, which lots of people do, you start here and you can sort of filter, sorry, you can filter different things, and you select the different combinations of features that you want. And then you select the geographies and what variables you want in the output and how you want them broken down. It's very specific. It's fairly self explanatory. Once you get through, it just sort of asks you a series of questions and it's a bit fiddly, so I won't show the whole process. But you could, for example, determine how many people describe themselves as Christian by a percentage of the population and compare that between 2001 to 2011. Yeah, so you can see people are getting less Christian, I guess maybe they're just getting less religious. And for boundary data, this is great. Because Yeah, the last session was on mapping. And for that you need shape files. And if you want shape files, we've got your shape files. So we do great big shapes, like regions, you know, and then down to sort of smaller and smaller divisions. I think the smallest one that we have, 

Sam  
Oh, you've, you've gone back. It's happened again 

Julia Kasmire  
Again? 

Sam  
 Yeah. Yeah, sorry. 

Julia Kasmire  
That's al right. I mean, I have no idea why it's doing this. Does this to me, okay. Okay, but, okay. Yeah, so you can get all these different kinds of shape files are really useful. And then you know, that if you get the really small ones, like super Output areas that lets you zoom in and really see the detail of an area. This is a marriage aside, for example, the world if you wanted to make a map of the world, or anywhere else. So there's the different boundary data tools that you can get. You can go by post codes, you can go by, sort of Jeep census boundaries, you can, you know, sort of describe things visually, you can like capture areas, there's a lot of different options. And we give them all to you if you want them, assuming you want them and flow down. And the final kind of census data I'm going to talk about is an aggregate in which there is both an origin and a destination. So typically, this is relates to commuting and migration, but there's also some things like, I think, second homes and vacations or something like that. I'm not sure mostly it's focused on commuting and migration. Because these are the ones where it matters most. So that is the flow data is kind of micro data. So it's about where I live and where I work. Although right now those are the same place. I assume that's true for all of you. And so, individually, within the census micro data, individual level data has been anonymized. And that results in a sample of anonymized records. So if you want the macro data, it's everyone. So if you want, for example, the total number of people in a given geographic area, that's macro data, that's everyone. But if you want micro data, it's a sample of anonymized records. This is to make sure that you can't identify people protect confidentiality, depending on the specific micro data that you're interested in. It's typically between one and 5% of the whole data set because they really want to be very good. protective of someone's confidentiality. Like any micro data, you need a statistical analysis package. And you know, it's very flexible, you can produce your own tables and you can get the anonymized records from several different years. So now, how how exactly do you register with the UK data service to get access to all this amazing shiny gold plated data? Well, basically you just show up at our website and hit register. But if you're already a UK University, you can use your institutional username and password and login and that will mean you are not challenged when trying to access the data services that we have that are a bit restricted. But if you don't have a UK University, username and password, you can still apply, it's fine. You just have to create your own. I know another another username and password. And, yes, it's pretty easy to show up to the web page, click Login register. And so once you do that, and you actually get in here, rooting around and looking under neath all of the rocks and inside up all the drawers of our data sets, you know, you probably want to start looking for and downloading data. And there's there's lots of different things. So you might find the get a little bit lost, you know, do you want to know about languages or psychology or history or economics is there's loads of stuff. So how do you use search? Well, of course, the search bar, I've mentioned it before, feel free to use it. And then there's a lot of other resources and help that might help you as well. So things like we have advice for new users. So if you get on and use the search bar and you kind of don't understand what it is You're back and you think Wait, wait, hold on, I'll get a big picture for you go to the advice for new users. It's through the, the sort of link at the top right of our homepage. Because, yeah, we want to make it easy for people to get to the advice for new users. And we also have lots of events like this webinar, for example, up in the news and events section, also at the top right of our homepage, we have news, as I mentioned, we have a blog. So it's basically a news event with a bit of opinion thrown in events like a webinar. We also have past events, so if you see one that you've missed or that you couldn't attend, we do offer the slides and a recording of the event on our YouTube channel. You know, we have a lot of basic stuff earlier today. I attended one on Power Pivot and dynamic arrays and it made me hate Excel a whole lot less It was really good. Yeah, then we do things like coding demonstrations. So if you want to figure out how to use Python to interact with an API to, you know, turn JSON data into something more useful, come along to our free online twitch sessions. I think we have one tomorrow and then one again next week. This is part of the new forms of data training, which is why I'm quite so keen on it. And, yeah, then we have all kinds of things on use data. This is sort of a walk through how people have used our data, how we recommend people use our data. So there's advice and training and guides and video tutorials. There's data skills modules, which are sort of themed sets of questions and videos that you can walk through to explore particular topics. For example, you know, if you wanted to, if you felt like I hadn't said enough about survey data, you could go through our survey data module. And that looks, you know, starts off here, it's got these little next buttons so you can advance through the different units. This one has a little video that shows how to open a data set and sort of start analysing it. We've also got a help desk. So you can just send us questions and genuine human people, you know, the questions that are sent in or distributed out to the genuine human person who will answer you based on what their specialty is what their experiences. So, you know, that's that's reassuring to know that it's not just bots, answering your questions. So if you find anything weird in your data, or you think there's an error, yeah, absolutely. Let us know. If you have questions, let us know. And then there's me all of my information. You can contact me or not, that's fine. Let me just escape this screen.
