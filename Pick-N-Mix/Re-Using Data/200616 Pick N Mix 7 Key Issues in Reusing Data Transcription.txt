Patty Doran  
So welcome to this webinar about getting started with secondary data really. So my name is Patty, and I work for the UK data service and I'm based at the University of Manchester just realised I should share my screen. So hopefully you all can see that if you're, if the little videos are in the way you can minimise those. So that will hopefully it won't stop seeing the slides. And so just to give an overview of the session, I'm going to talk about data that's available for reuse. Then I'm going to concentrate on talking about issues around reusing quantitative data types and then move on to consider issues around qualitative data. However, you'll see that many of the issues are the same such as Do I understand my data and where it's come from? Is it appropriate for the analysis that I want to do? I'm going to aim to talk for Around 35 minutes, and then answer any questions you have. as Sam said, you can type questions as we go in the chat box. And we'll answer them at the end. If you have anything that's really pressing, and you think that you do want to talk about it now, hopefully Sam's monitoring the chat, and we can stop it and address something if it's if you think that's appropriate. So I'm happy to just play it by ear a bit when it comes to that. But most questions will be at the end, I think. So first, I'm just going to talk about a little bit about reusing data, which is also referred to as secondary data analysis. So data comes from data collectors. And for data collectors the data is their primary data and data being collected for a specific research purpose. data collectors include organisations, such as net sin, perhaps or the official statistics organisations such as that is an academically driven programme projects such as understanding society, which is just an example We'll have a major longitudinal study of households in the UK, which is based out of the University of Essex, and individual researchers and research teams. Also data collectors. There's a photo there of Peter Townsend, who did some seminal work on research on poverty. In addition to primary research data is often archived. So it can be used in secondary data analysis. And that's where we come in. So through sharing data, we're able to reuse data. There's an example there, there's a photo of Hans Rosling, who produces really engaging graphs showing changes in health and poverty over time. And that's all done with secondary data. So there are some pros and cons to secondary data analysis. You can use data that you could not collect yourself. For example, secondary data analysis allows you to use data collected from different points in time and across different countries. For example of interested in working conditions over time, archive data From surveys such as the labour force survey, which goes back many years, and provides data that could not be collected now, so therefore sometimes reusing available data is the only option to answer the question or proposal that you have similarily single researchers or research teams do not always have the resources and expertise needed to produce major data collections. So secondary analysis is cost efficient, and the UK data service collection hold surveys with samples and the thousands that can be downloaded from a website after a short registration process. So you can obtain very high quality data, and data from the main collection undergoes checks for quality and clarity. So most collections come from trained researchers and methodologists from universities or government departments or statistics authorities. So together these advantages provide a reason to consider if you can make use of some of the options have data available, just to say as well that all the ethical issues around data collection are already dealt with by the data collector as well. There are some common disadvantages to secondary data analysis, you do not have the insider understanding of how that data was collected. So, you'll need to spend quite a bit of time familiarising yourself the process and how it was collected and how the data is structured. And so that's you need to spend effort to get to know the data. And there's still some ethical issues, you know, you have to it might mean that the data is restricted because of some of the sensitive data within it. So you'll have to consider that in your research question when you're designing it. And on the research question, the data might not match the research question. You might have an idea of your perfect project, but maybe the data doesn't quite match up with that. So you might have to tweak things a bit to make it all fit And you cannot extend the study. So you cannot continue them, you're kind of stuck with the amount of data that you have. But the key things to remember here are that you have to make an effort to understand the data. So read the documentation. And also be pragmatic about whether the data are good enough for your purpose, you know, might not match your original goal. But it might be close enough where you might be able to tweet your questions to make it work for you. So just have a look at the research plan and the research research process. So generally, you'd start with a research question. You'd find some data, which you think would answer that question. You'd evaluate that data and maybe do some initial sort of descriptive analysis. And then you'd move on to your full programme of analysis. So it kind of looks like a linear process. But it's not always. As I said, you might start to explore the data, or evaluate the data and realise that it's not going to answer your research question. So you might have to go back and find an alternative data set, or maybe go back to your research question and tweak that again. And similarly, once you get to the analysis process, you might realise that you're just not getting the answers you want. And you might have to go back again and go through the process once more. So it's an iterative process. So you need to familiarise yourself with the relevant documentation in order to make sense of your data. To understand the meaning of the data and to evaluate the suitability for your research question, you must understand exactly what information was collected, and who that information was collected from and where and when that data was collected. And it's also important to understand if any changes have been made to that raw data set before it was archived and before you were able to access it. But all this information will be available with the data in the in the documentation So most data sets come with a whole range of user guides, questionnaires, interviews, schedules, and all sorts of technical reports to help you understand the data. And I say it helps you understand the data. Often these documents are very detailed and long. So they can be quite hard to trawl through. But that's where we're here to help as well. If you ever have any trouble accessing any of the information from the data at the UK data service, you can sort of email through to us, and we can help you locate those details. So now I'm just going to go a bit more specific about quantitative data and look at a case study and what sort of data is available and what sorts of documentation are available and just highlight some of the key issues. So I'm going to look at a case study from the crime survey for England and Wales. And this is a large repeated cross sectional survey. So it's important source of about crime. And so it sort of complements the crime statistics from police records. It's an annual survey with interviews going on throughout the year. And there's about 35,000 people that they interview every year, age 16. Plus, there's also 3000, children aged and young people aged between 10 and 15. And from that sample, we also ask people if they've been a victim of crime in the previous 12 months. So there's separate data sets available for people who were a victim of crime and people who weren't and we collect their attitudes. So crime related subjects such as attitudes to the police and to the criminal justice system. And this is what the data looks like. So data is stored as individual anonymized records. And you can see it's got all the variables across the top and all the different categories that it comes in. So they're very large datasets and you need to use some sort of statistical power. programme to delve into them. And for any data through the UK data service, there's different levels of access. We do have some open data, but they generally quite reduced data sets. And mainly used for teaching. But you can, most people can apply for a standard end user licence and download data straight away after registering. And as you saw, our data is secure access only. And that will generally be for data that's got more sensitive variables within it. So as an example, the case here talks about a study done by an khilafah and colleagues that examined violence against people with disability in England and Wales. So they use data from the British crime survey and the 2019 data set, which was the first time that introduced a measure of disability. And so they had 46,000 adults All of whom over 9000 held at least one limiting disability. And they found that after adjusting for age and sex and all the normal things that you'd expect them to adjust for disability still increase the risk of experiencing violence. And also levels of victimisation were highest amongst those with mental health problems. And from those findings, they estimated that in the general population, there were 116,000, victims of violence that were attributable to disability. So just talking about the types of different types of quantities of data that you might use in your analysis. There are different kinds of quantitative data and they're suitable for different kinds of analysis. To examine individuals or families or households or businesses, perhaps at one point in time, you can use cross sectional survey data, or census micro data. If you want to look at trends over time, there are repeated cross sectional surveys and when call these kinds of data UK surveys and our catalogue. And that's, for example would be the crime survey for England and Wales. And if you want to be able to follow specific individuals over time, then you want longer to donate data and understanding society as an example of this kind of data. And it follows people in 40,000 households and covers a very wide range of topics. And they've actually got currently a subsection of that survey going to capture people's experiences during COVID-19. So it's going to be very valuable data. And in terms of geography, for looking at small geographical areas, the census aggregate data and flow data are a good source. And to compare countries there are collections of international macro data such as World Bank indicators. So to find out where, when and why this data was collected, it's best to start with the catalogue record information about geographic coverage and where and when the data was collected is all available on the catalogue page. So every single deposit separate to positive data has its own catalogue record. And you can see it This one is the British Social Attitudes were in 2013. And that's a survey that's run over several years, but this catalogue record is specific to the 2013 data collection. Also, from the catalogue page, you'll find access to documentation, including the user guides and technical core reports that I mentioned earlier. So it's also important to understand what questions were asked and how that was kind of moved into the data. For example, this is a small part of the questionnaire from the 2014 quarterly labour force survey. And document looks a bit different for different surveys. But this gives you a general idea. I mean, this is probably a better case of Good question here looks like. And in this case, you can see we're looking at information for a variable called flex tin, which relates to working arrangements. And you can see on this screenshot, the exact wording of the question and the range of answers with the coding. And if you look below, it says that the question applies to the response of the respondent isn't work. And this tells you how they defined someone who's in work. So Computer Aided interviewing makes it easy to send respondents through the questionnaire by different routes depending on their answers. So is need to note that many questions may not be applicable to some of the sample. And this might lead to misleading data. So depending on how people answer one question that will lead them through the questionnaire in different paths. You can also done load information that tells you how derived variables were created. So you can find out how the data was pretty processed. For example, the picture on the screen shows how the data from flex 10 variable was used to create a variable indicator someone had a zero hours contract. So, use this is known as a derived variable. And there will be a list in most data set documentation of all the derived variables that have been created. So, surveys and similar sources almost always you are based on samples. So, one important question is that you should ask is the sample representative and you will need to consider who was included in the sample, what was the response rate and is there any information about differential response across the population? You also need to find out if you need to use a survey weights and in most cases you will and the weights will be provided with the data. Second question is whether you have had enough cases to make precise estimates with the crime survey. for England and Wales, the sample is really quite large. So it does allow for precise estimates. However, if you're using smaller samples or interested in a particular sub population, there may not be sufficient cases within the sample. But more information is available through the UK data service on survey weights and complex sampling, if you're considering those sorts of analysis. And just finally, on quantitative data to say, and also on the catalogue page, there's always a reference to the data set. So we encourage people to cite the data as well as anything else they're citing in their reports. So people who are looking at your analysis can go straight to the source of where the data came from. And it just increases transparency about your work. And here's some general references that you may want to look up and then the links to the UK data service resources. So You'll be able to see those later on when the slides are circulated or it's up on the website.

So now I'm just going to talk about qualitative data. First, I'm going to go through a couple of different types of qualitative data reuse projects, then I'll walk you through a case study of one of those types of reuse, then do a quick overview of how to get started using data, including addressing a couple of key issues that arise when trying to reuse data. And finally, I'll show you some ways of finding qualitative data on the UK Data Service website. So qualitative data use is not particularly common, but it's certainly becoming more common. And the UK data service is offering more qualitative data sets and accessible way than it's been able to do in the past. So I definitely encourage considering quality of data reuse, I think it's under reused. So there are many ways you can reuse qualitative data, you can quite simply give a description or understanding of a particular social or historical point in time. Why this is useful is because you can see more of the data than what publications would reveal. You may not be able to see all the data depending on what is available in the archive, but you can see more data than what was originally published. And this is useful because you won't be limited to what resource researchers thought was salient for the research questions and topics, and you can explore it further and see what would be of interest to answer your questions. Another way to reuse data is to consider analysing the methods used and learn lessons about the most effective way of sampling data collection methods or developing topic guides. Perhaps one thing that is especially valuable is look at how an interview was laid out before the interview was conducted. And as what questions interviewers thought they were going to ask and then look at what was actually talked about in the interviews. There can be many reasons why certain questions are not asked in interviews. Some interview schedules are designed to be more flexible. Or sometimes tangents come up and you want to interrogate those further. And in any case, it's important researcher skill to have the intuition to know what to do. And you can really can't see that unless you're comparing the interview schedules with the actual interview transcripts, and it's possible through secondary quality of data. Another reuse is called re analysis, which looks at a wide range of approaches that you can take and the analysis of a data set. It usually means asking some kind of different research question from what the original researchers were trying to do. For example, seal and charters, black did a study using comparative keyword analysis of illness narratives. The original illness narratives have been looked at exclusively for health research, but when Zeeland Charteris black came along to do the comparative keyword analysis, they were much more interested in an analysis of the discussions rather than the actual health issues. came up in interviews. So the question can be very different in that way, or sometimes the Christian you'll be on a similar topic to the original research but have a slightly different focus. For example, Joanna borne it looked at G ontology as a topic and found two different data sets looking at specifically this topic. However, her research question was on racism, which wasn't the focus of the original work, but the dataset was rich enough to allow her to explore this thing with an existing data.

So finally, data is also reused for teaching and learning. And this gives students the opportunity to work with real data and also gives them some hands on experience of working through analysis of data and issues that arose from different mythological choices. There are a number of teaching data sets available through our website, as well as other teaching resources which are, which is archive data to walk students through various mythological and thematic issues and as a type of reuse Which is exemplified by the case study I'm going to go through with you now. And this case is what's called a re study. So, which is where you replicate the methods of a study for purposes of comparison, you may be looking at a historical comparison, which could help you demonstrate how society has changed over time. Or it could be geographical class or, or a comparison of other variables to show differences between subgroups. The example of this kind of reuse project is from the project school leavers study. And this original study was conducted by Ray Paul in the late 70s. As part of a much wider community study of the art of shipping. The UK data service holds a number of collections related to this community study, but the school leavers study specifically looked at student aspirations. Paul asked teachers to set a particular essay just before students would usually have scuttle prompting them to imagine that they were reaching the end of their life. And something made them think back to the time that if school and they were then assigned To write a short essay of what happened and their life over the next 30 to 40 years. And in 2009, Graham Crowe and Dawn lie on and that's Graham Crowe there with Ray Paul decided to return out to re analyse this data set and focus solely on student aspirations. So using a very similar methodology, they conducted a research study of school leavers for students on the iOS GP in 2009. So the prompt supplied students was very similar to their data collection. And it was nearly all at the same time. So imagine you're at the end of your life and reflect back on what you've done since leaving school, then transcribed the essays and appeared the things from the set of essays to the set of essays collected back in the 70s. And you can see the wording of the prompt and the small snippet of one essay here. There was a challenge in doing a reanalysis of the specific study when the original study happened. I sort of stumbled on finding teachers and assigned to the essay, they were able to share the essays with them, but he didn't have absolute control over how that is there was presented and collected to students so that original data also show up the markup from the teachers and how they were graded. When Graham Crowe did the research study, these were not matched and the research team had more control over the essay prompt. So Kroger is in some detail about this and devised this prompt based on conversations with Ray Paul, about his original study. Nevertheless, though, this is point CRO addresses in his publications and come to the conclusion that the overall picture painted by essays is collective offers a valuable comparison. And the findings showed, as you might imagine, a shift and aspirations. And here's just a few more details about what they received back. So there was a slightly different gender divide, but similar amount of data received. Both datasets covered the same general themes of how Education, career and family leisure, although in very different ways. So how exactly were they different so in 1978, students expected much more grounded and arguably mundane sorts of jobs. career progression was gradual and followed on from hard work and sometimes there was talk of periods of unemployment or even death. You can see a few examples on the left hand column of some other connotations from this essays, such as the one at the bottom, which is, I longed for something exciting and challenging, but yet again, I had to set up a second best, again working in a large clothes factory. By 2010, however, students aspirations have changed they were imagining, well paid and instantaneous jobs filled with choice but also with some uncertainty. For example, you can have the quote at the bottom on the right of the girl who writes in my future, I want to become either a dance teacher, hairdresser or professional show jumper horse rider. If I do become a dancer, my dream would be to dance for Beyonce or someone really famous. So you can see how things have changed over time.

Patty Doran  
And the impact of the study spans beyond the interesting changes I've noted in young people's aspirations. The study was part of a much bigger community project on the past, present and future of the art of shipping. And the goal wasn't to engage with the community alongside this research and find innovative ways of including the participants and the research outputs. So as part of this initiative, they published the living and working shippi website, which has videos and artwork produced by residents of the aisle, as well as ways of those who participate in the research to stay in touch with each other and read about the history of their community. So they have to create a shared history and memory of what living on the art of shipping means among this community. There's a number of publications that you can read about the project and as As I said, this case demonstrate just one way of reading reusing qualitative data, which is a comparative research study and comparison between the two data sets. So we've covered different types of reuse projects you can do. But what about actually doing secondary analysis. So, as with quantitative data, the first thing you need to do is to orient yourself with the original research project. I think the main point to make here, which is very much the same as reusing quantitative data is to not under estimate the amount of time it will take to get acquainted with the data set. There may be multiple levels of context to get through in order to really understand the data. And what I mean by that is you will have more than just the data that is collected that time of the interview or data collection, you may also need to consider the metadata of the participants or the historical time period in which the data was collected, and where the data was predicted. So really, the idea is that you really need to understand the data set as a whole In order to get to the root of what the data can convey, the documentation provided with the data set will be really useful starting point for this. It often contains more information about the methodology such as the interview schedule, or the call for participants, or sometimes it includes segments from publications arising out of the original study or funding applications. But the documentation does vary, could also include background and contextual material taken from the area of research or meeting minutes or government pamphlets or letters from participants. And all this helps to paint the picture of what was going on around the study, it would be included in the documentation, you may also need to consider the sample. For example, if the data set is too large, you may need to take a sub sample. This may not be as much of an issue with qualitative research, since they're usually smaller studies anyway, but there are some glitches would have gotten larger. amount of funding and you'll need to carefully consider what's feasible. For example, we've got a collection called the IDW audience collection, which was put together by Paul Thompson, and widely considered the first oral history of Britain. But it contains 453 80 Plus page interviews. So this would take a considerable amount of time to read and reread, so you may want to take a sample of this. Conversely, you might find that interviews from different data sets complement each other and make a new, larger data set, which would be useful if you combined it. So finally, if you think through how you will approach the data, you might use an adaptive strategy where you start with the data and see what comes from that. Or a deductive strategy where you have a firmer idea of what you're looking at within the data. And both are equally valid, but you will need to consider your approach as you get started. And that's just a very brief overview of a couple of issues when getting started. quality of data reuse. If you're looking for more guidance or discussion on the issue of these two resources on the side are highly recommended, first and foremost as a chapter on a Solomon's most recent edition of qualitative research, and Debbie Bishop wrote this chapter specifically on reusing qualitative data. And it's filled with further examples of reuse and addresses these key issues in more depth if you have access to this book through your library, or it's definitely recommended, starting with that chapter. There is also a timescape method guide series which is available online. So it might be a bit more accessible. And it's short. It's just a few pages from Sarah Irwin and Mandy winter to 10. But it's another great guide to help get you started. So there are other resources available through our website as well. If you explore our UK Data Service website by clicking the use data tab, which is at the top of the page, and then select secondary analysis. From the left hand menu, you'll find tips for using or reusing both quantitative and qualitative data. And here you can see there is a short guide, as well as a bibliography of resources that can help get you started. And so just finally, I just want to go through a couple of ways to look for quality of data. First by going to key data found by clicking on get data. And there is a quality of mixed methods tab. So from that tab, you will find some information about how to locate data. The other common way to look for data and this goes for both qualitative and quantitative data is to by going through our data catalogue. The data catalogue is at the homepage and it works like Google you simply search using a keyword as I've done here for poverty. And once the search results come up, you can see the filters on use the filters on the left to refine the results. But perhaps the best way to look at the quality of data is to use the colleague bank. And you can see there's a link there up on the right from the catalogue search. Like the data catalogue, you simply type in a keyword but instead of searching through the abstracts and catalogue pages, like the catalogue does quali bank actually searches through the data itself. So this means you may be able to identify relevant interviews that have been spread across different collections, or find a collection where you didn't think the right thing might come up. And this example, I've typed in poverty, and you can see that it's searched through and highlighted in the data itself, where it is mentioned. And you can see the first three search results here, including an interview with Peter towns in and one of the essays from the school leavers study. When you click on one of the search results in poly bank, it brings you straight to the spot in the data your keyword as mentioned, if you scroll to the top of the page, you can also see that there are links to external resources and collection documentation. And if I click on that, it would bring me to the bottom of the page, which includes things like audio extracts and transcripts, and images related to interview or sometimes even web resources. Finally, one last feature of quality bank is if you wanted to cite directly from an interview transcript, you can simply click on the Create citation button, which you can see here on the left hand menu. And then you highlight the portion of text that you're interested in at which point that creates is a citation citation button will then turn into a retrieve citation button, which you can click and you'll see this pop up. And you can copy and paste the citation into your document and it's got a persistent identifier in it, which is the URL which you see at the end of the citation. And that brings the reader directly to the exact paragraph you have highlighted within quality bank. So this introduces a new layer of transparency to your work, and also helps you accurately cite the data that you're using. So just in summary, in relation to reusing both quantitative and qualitative data, there are many benefits of reusing data. it's cost effective if it's completed. And in many cases, it gives you access to large scale research. But just bear in mind that it's an iterative process, you know, the data that you have might not directly answer your research questions that you ideally want to pose. So you might have to go back and through the process of locating appropriate data and evaluating it. Nathan's done your analysis and then going back just to refine your data, your research question and the data that you're using. But it's really important to consider the context. So consider the methodology and the prior research and why that data It was collected to begin with. So you need to plan and prepare and use the study documentation to understand as well as you can the data that you're using. But just to reiterate as well, that we, I work for the user support and training team at the UK data service. And we are here to support you accessing and using our data. So as well as all the resources we've got on our website, and there are quite a lot of resources on our website, whether the PDF guides, or user guide videos, or old webinars. You can also contact us through the help desk and we can support you on a one to one basis. And just a final reminder down the end to cite the data and where it came from. And so that's it. That's the website there. Our Help Desk email, YouTube channel as well. We have all our video guides that we've been asked. And you can also follow us on Twitter to find out what we're doing and if there's anything interesting coming up which just remind May. In July, I'm running a online workshop series, specifically aimed at people using data in the third sector, and how our resources and data might be beneficial to anyone from a third sector. So if you're interested in reusing actual data and finding out a bit more about the data sets, those online workshops might be something that you're interested in.
