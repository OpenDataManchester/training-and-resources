OpenStreetMap is a free and editable map of the world, created and maintained by a huge international community. It's used in numerous projects by local communities, governments, software developers and more, with nearly 5 million registered users and 1 million contributors from all over the world.

It includes data about roads, buildings, addresses, shops and businesses, points of interest, railways, trails, transit, land use and natural features, and much more.

We'll explore the fundamentals of mapping with OpenStreetMap, some tools and apps, best practice, and some re-use by 3rd party projects.

Whether you're completely new to OpenStreetMap and want to find out more, or whether you've used it before and wish to dive a bit deeper, then this is for you.
