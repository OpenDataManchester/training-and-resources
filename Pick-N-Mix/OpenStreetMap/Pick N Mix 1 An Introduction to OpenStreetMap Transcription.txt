Sam  
So, yes, welcome to this is an introduction to OpenStreetMap. So this is a briefly what we'll cover. As I say, there's a good mix of people here this evening. And this is aimed as an introductions but as I say, I really hope that you get something new out of this, we're going to cover actually a brief history of OpenStreetMap. And what OpenStreetMap actually is, what people use it for, how you can contribute, and we'll look at a different few ways in which you can contribute add and edit OpenStreetMap by looking at some different tools, but also some third party applications, and there will be some chances for us to go in and have an explore as well. The aim is that this session with me presenting in Austin, a few exercises should only really take by an hour, I'm hoping it won't be longer than an hour. And then we'll just have an open session at the end. If people just want to hang around, have a chat, do a little bit of networking, maybe that kind of thing. Or if you've had enough, you've had enough zoom for one day, and you want to get off. That's absolutely fine. Just quickly, a little bit about open data, Manchester. If you've, if you're new to us, if you've met it, perhaps you're not from Manchester, and say you've never been to one of our events before. Welcome, open day in Manchester where a CIC were formed in 2010. And we're one of the very first open data organisations so we work across sectors, with individuals with organisations to help things like data literacy build capacity within organisations through a wide and varied programme. We work internationally, so helping cities with their Open Data strategies. We work nationally so we've helped develop things like open data standards, and locally we run a programme of training events works shops such as our data for communities programme, which helps people to understand where they live by exploring the information and data available to them. So that's just a very sort of in a nutshell what what we do. You can see there there's my my direct contact details that are meant to sort of point out on this slide if you want to is our website and email address and if you want to follow us on Twitter, that's there.

Sam  
And this is me so yeah, I'm programming events officer open data, Manchester, there's my contact details and my twitter if you so wish to follow me on there. So basically, if you've come to something over the last year or so run by open data, Manchester, chances are you've met me a little bit about my background. I guess I've spent the last nearly 10 years sort of working in digital and elearning. So I've worked at the British Council helping to digitise and get their Film Archive online to working for code club in its very early years. And then I've worked sort of for an online literacy intervention as well as stints during bits of teaching adults English, that kind of thing. But yeah, I've been open data Manchester for nearly two years now. And I've always loved sort of OpenStreetMap I've always been really fascinated and interested by it. So. So, to begin with, let's go back in time, to OpenStreetMap. Some of you might have heard of a woman called Phyllis Piersall. So we're going back in time now to about 1935 or so the story goes, Phyllis gets lost in London. She's got her Ordnance Survey map, but it's from 1919. So it's about 16 years out of date. It's quite big, has no index, it's not of much help to her. Now, Phyllis, her father was a cartographer, so she has some knowledge and a bit of experience in mapping. So she decides she's going to create her own map of London. I believe she walked about 25,000 streets something like 3000 miles, and doing like 16 to 18 hour days over a long period of time, which sounds crazy, right? But the result is the very first London A to Zed, which you know it particularly for the UK, you probably know very, very well. So let's fast forward now to the early 2000s, another Londoner, a man named Steve coast, or at least a man in London at the time, he's trying to get around. But there's no freely available digital maps. Now. This is 2004. So the first iteration of Google Maps won't come out until about a year later. And it wouldn't really launch until about 2008. Now, so obviously, there's no Apple Maps, there's no Bing Maps, etc, either. And we're so used to having these things in our pocket. It's kind of hard to think that actually wasn't that long ago. But Wikipedia has just started to become a thing. And Steve's got a GPS device. So he thinks why not make one myself. So he does. He captures data via his GPS and starts to map. And Steve figured that a single dot, like what you can see on your screen there could just represent a place a pub or shop. two dots joined together can be create, obviously a line, which could represent a road or a river, that kind of thing, a boundary. And then a series of lines that connect back on itself, like you should be able to see now can be the shape of a building, that kind of thing. And just like that, he starts to collect really basic mapping data, and he begins to add more and more detail. And just like Wikipedia, he lets other people join in, and the result eventually is OpenStreetMap. 

Sam  
So, what you should be able to see now is a screen grab of what OpenStreetMap At least manche at Greater Manchester and the surrounding areas looks like free free my computer anyway. So what is OpenStreetMap? Well, in short OpenStreetMap is a completely free editable map of the world. It's built from the ground up by millions of volunteers from all over the globe. One way of looking at it is a Carter graphical Wikipedia. What does that mean? It means that like Wikipedia, anybody can add, edit, fix things, and also use it for whatever purpose you want, no one will charge you. You don't pay a fee or you don't have to commit to anything. It only requires attribution. So let's have another deeper look at OpenStreetMap I'm actually going to start by not showing you OpenStreetMap I'm going to show you this is a screen grab of a park in South Manchester, taught in park from Google Maps and just take a quick executor look at that you can kind of see that it's a park there. Now I'm going to show you the same park in OpenStreetMap. So for starters, you can actually see the park. It's quite, you know, it's green, for starters. But there's a lot more detail in it, there's playing fields is pathways, and you can even see the children's park in there. I really like this because there's just so as I say, there's just so much more detail if you compare the two. So I thought that what we could do, just to start with, I'm going to stop sharing my screen for a moment if it will let me I thought we could maybe just spend five minutes maybe and just open up OpenStreetMap and stop scaring sharing my screen day. I thought maybe what we could do is Yeah, if we go to I think it's openstreetmap.org and I'm going to just pop this into the chat function for everyone. You unfortunately I think you might have to copy and paste it into your browser. Gonna just pop it on there for you. So OpenStreetMap dog, and I thought we might just spend a few minutes. And just looking at the map and maybe focus in on where, where you live. So just zoom into where you live. And we'll just spend a couple of minutes and having a little look at what we can see. And don't worry, by the way, we're just looking at the map at this point, we're not going to be we're not editing anything.So you don't have to worry about that. But yeah, maybe just have a little look at what you can see. Maybe even what's missing, have a little think about how does it compare to other maps you're used to. So maybe you use Google Maps all the time. Is there anything surprising? That kind of thing, so let's just maybe let's just spend a couple of minutes looking at got that. Okay, so yes, so. So yeah, as you'll notice OpenStreetMap is it is very, very detailed, and they are big on details. And they're also really big on accuracy. I think that's also something that's quite important. And if you did, if you were able to look at the query function, and you saw all the data on the left hand side, as I said, you'll notice that each feature is also tagged. So if you can imagine you can add a data point or or data points, then basically use this really flexible tagging system to best describe what the feature is using as much detail as possible. But I'll come back to this in a bit. So don't worry about that for now. Okay, but I thought I'd have a little look at how OpenStreetMap is used and what it actually is. So again, I'm gonna go back to Question What, what actually is OpenStreetMap. And this is where I'm going to confuse you slightly, particularly if you're new to OpenStreetMap. Technically speaking, OpenStreetMap is not actually a map. It's a database. So what we see in the browser on openstreetmap.org is a visual representation of that database. So interestingly, this map is not actually intended to be used as, say, Google Maps, although people do use it that way. I use it that way. And as I say, it does have some directional functions. But primarily this map is used to add data to the database and to check that what you are adding is right. That's that's one use of it. The intention is that other people, other organisations will use this data for their own projects or you Use it to create their own maps. So what sorts of maps what sort of projects what sort of things do people use it for. I'm going to show you a few examples now. And this one takes data from waterway except this is showing accessible waterways across Europe. And I've just highlighted Greater Manchester in the surrounding areas. So this is a map that you can go to now and have a look at all the accessible waterways across Europe. I will share links to these I will at the end I'll send a follow up email that will link to everything I'm showing so don't worry too much about these for now.

Sam  
This is a really good one. I love this one. This is a tourist map of Addis Ababa and I believe that the city actually the city itself actually paid for locals to map the city and create this tourist map. So this is a fully functional tourists. map. You can kind of see on the left hand side there, it's got information on sites of interest hotels, that sort of thing. This is a personal favourite of mine. This is Bexhill a local Bexhill map back to in East Sussex on the south coast. And there's again, it's built by the community down there lots of history, lots of information about Bexhill, it's got things like where you can find local artworks. And also you can overlay historical maps onto this so you can sort of choose to see what it would look like in 1917, and so on. So I think that this is a really nice sort of little example. Another favourite of mine, and I do absolutely love this one. This takes real data from OpenStreetMap but renders it in a fun sort of eight bit style computer game map and they've got a number of cities from all over the world that you can choose a really really like this one But there's also things like this sort of the humanitarian OpenStreetMap team and projects such as this and Missing Maps and I'll come back to those in a little bit but this is a team is as it says there they are dedicated to humanitarian actions. So they go in, particularly if there's been areas of war or natural disaster and it's almost like this team almost overnight, they will map the area. So first responders have up to date maps, so they know what their what their, you know, how to get to where they need to go. So, for example, would be the mudslide. I think that happened in Brazil last year. So overnight, the terrain was maps so they knew what how they could you know, what roads were still open and closed and destroyed, and so on. But just some other really, really quick examples. You know, people have used it to map things like solar panels, wind farms, energy, so they use it for if you're buying a house To sort of, you know, see how close it is to certain things, post boxes, and I'm going to come back to that one later on. And the chances are actually, if you if you've gone on to certain websites, perhaps looking at local council services, you might actually be looking at a map that uses OpenStreetMap. Often, if you look to the bottom right hand side of the map, you'll see attribute ID there. I believe that Apple Maps has now actually if you go onto your iPhone, and click Apple Maps and click on the i actually says that it uses data from OpenStreetMap, which is really so how could How can you contribute to to OpenStreetMap? So anyone can use the data. Anyone can add data? What sort of data can we add? Well, anything really to a point? Obviously, there are a few rules of thumb which which I'll cover in a bit.

Sam  
By far, the easiest and the most accessible way to add data to the map is using the in browser editor. I think some of you have already sort of had a look at that already. As I say, actually for that if you sign in for the first time, it will ask you if you want to do the walkthrough. And I do strongly recommend this, because it opens a sandbox version. So you can play around with it as much as you want without worrying about making any errors. I'll give you an example a minute. And then actually, we'll have a go at that too. But first, I'm going to explain a little bit about how mapping in OSM works. So, this is I sort of showed some of these during my introduction, it base so as I said, it basically uses a series of dots, or connected dots to define points, roads, buildings or anything else. In OpenStreetMap. We tend to call these dots, nodes or points. So you might hear me using those interchangeably. But a single note or a point it could, as I say, it could be a shop or a postbox or even a tree that counts. Anything. Here's an example. Again, this is example from South Manchester actually near that same Park I showed you earlier. I don't know, I don't know how clear that is on on my presentation. But actually, there's a pizza restaurant, you can kind of see those little arrows, which is sort of denoting where certain shops and pubs are. And I've highlighted a pizza place called double zero pizza. If any of you know double zero pizza, you'll know why I've highlighted it. And what you can sort of see so that point that's highlighted on the map, you can kind of see it's surrounded in red, that's the node or the point. And then on the left hand side, you can see all the information and tags have been added to it. So we can see that it's a pizza restaurant. You can see it's got its named, what sort of food it what sort of food it serves, you can put the address in there, the opening times that kind of thing. And what's really good with the in browser editor is it actually when you're adding something It guides you through and suggests all these tags. But in theory, you can add as much information as you like. So two nodes connected. So two dots become, yes, so it's a line or it, we call it a way. This can be a road or a canal, for example. Waves are directional. So what this means is that say in the case of a river, you want to try and draw it in the direction that the river is flowing. But don't worry, you could change this, you can edit it if you make a mistake, but that's just something that's quite important to point out, I think. So in this example, I'm showing the same bit of the map. I don't think it comes up very clear on here, but essentially, the yellow road that's going down from top to bottom there, I've clicked on that and I've highlighted it, that road will be made up of multiple, multiple connected points, so that you can really accurately Draw the shape of the road and again on the left hand side there You should be able to see the fact that they put down it's a main road, they've got the name of the road, the fact that it's not one way they've even got speed limit in there, how many lanes it's got, what type of surface is it, and the official road number, plus more plus much more information. And you'd also use that for doing footpaths, canals, rivers, that all of those. So lastly, a series of a line that connects back on itself can be a building or an area, a shape of a park or whatever. Again, another example. Same map on the left hand side there you can see that building has been highlighted. So if the buildings got name, you can add that you can add how many floors The building has the heights, if you'd happen to know the height, the address all of that. Okay, and then this is what it would look like if you were editing it so it uses satellite imagery. If you Let's see to be editing it in browser adding that sort of information. So let's say we've added our shop or building What next? Well, as I've been mentioning this the tagging system. Now, the tagging system is obviously there for us to give as much information as we can. But it also helps to standardise the data that we're putting into OpenStreetMap. We want to make sure that as best as we can, you know, we are naming things same and describing them in the same way. And as I've said, The in browser editor has this really helpful sort of guide, if you will. In the beginning, when OpenStreetMap was just really simple. The tagging system was quite straightforward. But obviously, as the map got evermore complex, and more and more people began to contribute to the map from all over the world, there's going to be way many more things, you know, way more things that we now need to talk about. But also people are going to be describing things in their own way depending on where they're from. So, as I say, most tagging is standardised so you can add the fact that it's a road, what type of road the road surface, there's many options available when I just recommend if you're doing this for the first time, just choose the best one that you can. And if you're not sure of it, then don't add it. I would say we we've sort of if you're if you're trying to add or tax something new, and perhaps there is no tagging system set up, the way that OpenStreetMap tends to work is on a consensus basis. So as I mentioned earlier, they started recently adding solar farms. So it might be that multiple people across the world are using a different tagging system. So what will happen is that new a new sort of tagging system is proposed, on the say, the OpenStreetMap community Wiki pages, and people start to use it adopt it, they might suggest better ones, and so on. And eventually something will get settled on and used as the kind of official one, so to speak, is worth bearing in mind that it's not a perfect system, but it is a consensus. As I say, it's a bit like Wikipedia, it kind of works on consensus basis. And also, if in doubt, the wiki which I've just mentioned is always worth is worth exploring. Again, I will touch on that in a minute. So what's easiest and quickest way, as I say, is just to start exploring and having a look. And if you haven't already, we will, in a minute, spend a bit of time just looking in the browser, the editor in the browser, and we'll ever play around with the walkthrough. But first, before we go any further, this is the reason why I had the warning sign up there. I just wanted to go through some rules of thumb, rules of thumb about when you are mapping or adding or editing to OpenStreetMap. Okay, so this is my favourite ever stock photo and I try to use it as often as I can and rule of thumb. There we are. So firstly, rule of thumb be as accurate as possible, the thing that you're mapping, you know, it has to exist, basically. And accuracy is key. That way you can see, so map what is actually on the ground and not what is in your memory. So, let's just say a shop down the road has just opened up and you know, it's there and you want to do it from home. I strongly recommend against doing that I would highly recommend going there taking a photo of it and bringing it back to do or going and doing it there perhaps via your browser via your mobile phone. So that's what's really important that was on the ground and, and not from your memory. That's how I could think I've covered that one. Yes, because obviously streaming a really good example actually of mapping on the ground. And this is quite interesting. But actually I street names might differ in official records. And then the actual sign that is on the streets. And in OSM you map what's on the street. So it has had a different name, you would still map what is on the street. Yeah, really important here, never steal from another source. And Firstly, you'd be breaking copyright. But also the data could be wrong. There were cases of OpenStreetMap errors being replicated in things like Google Maps and Apple Maps, which is how we know that Google we're using OpenStreetMap data. But as I say, and the streets and buildings, satellite imagery, that kind of thing. That's all that's all absolutely fine. I'm just going to gonna hammer this point home accuracy is key. So I'm gonna stop sharing my screen. I'll get there in a second. And what I thought we could do at this point is if we go back to openstreetmap.org. And maybe what we'll do is we'll have a little spends maybe 510 minutes by yourself, and just having a little play with the in browser editor. Now I will, I will strong. If you haven't signed up for an account. You might you need to sign up for an account in order to be able to edit. And if you sign in, and it asks you to do the walkthrough, please select Yes. As I've mentioned, this is a sandbox version that you'll be using. Yeah, so obviously, the in app browser that we've been looking at, is very, very handy, but it's obviously not suited to editing when you're out and about on the streets. So there are what's great about OpenStreetMap and the OpenStreetMap community, there are countless sorts of third party apps and programmes available for you to get to for you to take with you in your pocket in app. So here's just two examples. So Jonathan is a JavaScript OpenStreetMap editor is is actually for your desktop, or your your, your MacBook, or whatever it is you use. And what's really good about this is that it allows you to kind of download large amounts of data from the OpenStreetMap servers onto your computer. And and perhaps you can then edit large in large quantities, so you could do a whole area, edit is on your computer. Once you're happy, it's right then you can upload that data to OpenStreetMap. So what this allows you to do is essentially, yeah, edit and add large amounts of data, but you don't have to do it live. You can do it in your Your own time on your computer. And then when you're finished, upload it in bulk to the OpenStreetMap server. So yeah, that's called chosen. And then there are some really nice, really easy to use smartphone apps. This one on the right hand side is called go map. And I believe this is just on iOS. And there's another similar one on Android called Vespucci, these are just two of the popular ones. But there are loads more out there. I use go map, it's really, really simple. You literally just go to where you want to go. And you could just that you add a point or add whatever it is you want. And that's a really, really good way just to go out onto the street and actually maps a while you're out on your walk or whatever it is. If that new shop opens up I was talking about earlier, you can just quickly add it and add details. So yeah, there's some really, really, really good sort of apps out there for your iPhone and other things. To sort of let you edit in large quantities on your computer as well.

Sam  
Yeah, and I've also been talking about the wiki. So the wiki is kind of really, you'll find so much information on here, you'll find information on the, as you can see on that screen, it's got a beginner's guide, it's got a lot more information on apps that you can use, it's really helpful for things like tags. So the tagging systems, it's got, as I mentioned, great beginners guides, great examples of maps. And, and also, if you want to go deeper, you can go as deep as you want. I mean, you know, this is the sort of a, this is like the big a big handbook that comes with it as it as it were. And again, I will I will link to all of these. So I'm kind of what next and let's just say particularly if you're new to OpenStreetMap and you've You know, you've got a sense of what it is now. And let's just say that you want to, I would recommend the next steps really would be, try downloading one of the apps, if you've got an iPhone or Android or whatever, and just have a play. I would get out there and just start seeing, you know, maybe like on your government mandated exercise, just saying what's in your local park, what's there what's missing, and if there were, maybe a shop has changed hands and you want to edit it, I would just decide just to start to do it. But just remember the rules of rule of thumb that we talked about. There are some really cool projects to get involved with these will all be on the wiki and as I say on link to some of those, and some examples of projects. This is open plaques. So this is the the blue plaques that you can find around the country, locations where famous people lived. So there's a big database of people adding adding plaques. So that That's something that you might want to get involved in open benches. I think it's quite straightforward. It's literally mapping where public benches are around the world. I think that's great. And Missing Maps is something I touched on earlier. It's a little bit like the humanitarian team. They map areas, you know, for humanitarian organisations to help meet the needs of vulnerable people. And this one, I'm this is a really cool project that you could get involved in really, really easily. And particularly if you're in Manchester, I might want to talk to you about this. So this is about adding post boxes to OpenStreetMap. So although post box location data is released, it's not technically open data, so they're not allowed to just import it into OpenStreetMap. So, what this what someone has done is made this handy map, which shows just how much the postbox is In the UK, have been mapped.

Sam  
Again, I've zoomed in on Manchester. So apparently in OpenStreetMap, they've only mapped 19.5% of the postboxes in OpenStreetMap. And it will actually then also show you potentially where they might be and you can go and map them. So you could download one of the apps and as I say, on your day exercise, maybe go to your go to orbit next time you put something in your local postbox, you could then add that into OpenStreetMap. That could be quite a fun thing to do. I know there are some areas in the UK that have 100% coverage. There are some areas like Manchester that have only got a very, very low amount of coverage, likely where it says 100% they probably have a very strong OpenStreetMap community there. But that's a really, really, I think, a really, really nice project to get involved in a really good starting point. So yeah, so what next really I mean, we're kind of vaguely coming to the end of the story. One main presentation to the main session. So, as I say, I'd recommend the postbox exercise. That's something I'm going to start to do. And if you're interested to, let's have a chat once the session has ended, and I will send around links to this and everything else that we have mentioned in the session, but also do check out the wiki. You can sign up to be an Open Street Map member as well, particularly OSM UK. I think it's only something like five pounds a year OpenStreetMap is a there is a OpenStreetMap foundation is a sort of charitable foundation. They don't as I say, you know, they don't necessarily make money out of doing any of this and but they still need to keep the servers running. So things like signing up to become an OpenStreetMap member for five pounds a year really, really helps. Benefits of that. Well. They have lots of regional meetups and get involved in lots of quarterly quarterly projects. Now. Obviously, some of you here are what we're saying At the start that you were interested in seeing how OpenStreetMap can be used in projects, and as I say, OpenStreetMap is really a database that people use to make their own data. So maybe you want to start using this data for your own projects, you want to start making your own maps for that university need to have a an understanding of GIS, Geographical Information Systems. And I'm not going to be covering that today, unfortunately, because I just kind of wanted to keep it a bit simple and light. But what a coincidence. Next week's Pick and mix session is actually an introduction to cue jus, which is a bit like Ark just but cages is a free open source, GIS software, which does allow you to make your own maps and does allow you to make maps using OpenStreetMap data. So that's really cool. And so yeah, just just quickly before I sort of draw this session to a close, we will have and we will be online, I can ask the question In a second, I thought I would just quickly talk about what we've got coming up, opens, opened at Manchester we are doing it all our hope programme is obviously online. And this is the first in a series of eight in total. So on the left hand side there you can see some of our upcoming sessions. So next week, we've got a special key just the week after that we're doing an introduction to the UK data service. We've got an introduction to web scraping, an introduction to data analysis with Python to SQL to looking at key issues when reusing data and then also how to create lava lab plots with R so using R to create nice data visualisations and also open data Manchester we run monthly Open Data surgeries on the last Friday of each month. This is a chance if you are working on a project or you have questions or you're looking for a collaborator You want to know a little bit more about what is open data? And how can it help me, you could sign up for one of these and chat to me and Julian for half an hour or so on a Friday afternoon. We do this on the last Friday of each month, the link is there. I will share these around. And that's kind of it for me. I'm just gonna stop sharing my screen. And I'm sure there's questions that we should probably answer. So let me just have a little look. Okay, so I will put those sort of apps screen up again. So I'm just looking back at the questions. Question from Sam. What's the best way to find the appropriate key and value for particular features when using the API? Sam is referring to the tagging system, he sort of had a kid of value. Should we just explore the wiki? does it become more obvious with time? Yeah, I would say the wiki is Really, really is the place to start. They have a really in depth. There are some like pages and pages of pages of tagging and it's all so you can sort of search by category and that kind of thing. As I say, obviously if you're looking at a specific thing Yeah, I don't know if it's - Reka, you use these quite a lot. Don't use older whether whether your experience here can help answer that. Maybe we'll come back to that. So other questions that we got so Julian's helpfully been putting some links in the chat box?

Sam  
So Gareth. Regarding editors, there's quite directed editors like oh yeah, my product feature which map Roulette which focus on one or two particular features? I've not come across map roulette. Gareth.Gareth, would you like to unmute yourself? Is Gareth her or he has he gone? See I've not come across map map roulette before. So I wonder if Gareth wanted to share what that is. But maybe we can have a look at it. Open benches was embedded in Oxford just saying, No, I'm guessing you're from Oxford if you were to use so this is a this is a question from Hannah. If you were to use one of the apps to map features whilst using your phone, how accurate is the positioning? The phone uses longitude latitude. What does Open Street Map use? That's a good question. Yeah, I mean, obviously if you're going to be mapping with your phone, you can only map as as well. As you know, as accurately as your phone allows you, but a lot of the apps do, you know, allow you to position the node in the correct place. So I noticed earlier that the is a postbox of my corner, just around the corner that wasn't mapped. I was able to obviously, add that as a point, but then move it into that it was slightly off. So I was able to move that into the right position. And but as to whether, yeah, your phone uses longitude, latitude, and what does OpenStreetMap use what it uses? eastings and northings, longitude latitude? Do you know what how I don't actually that's one thing that's on my head. I'm not entirely sure if anybody else knows the answer to that, please. Include latitude longitude, but I'm not 100% Sure. Factor. It does use latitude and longitude. Yeah, there we go. Brilliant. Thank you guys. Oh, gathers here. It was gathered here, but it has no mic. Okay. Thank you, Gareth.
