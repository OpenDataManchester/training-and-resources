**In this session, Julia covers:**

- a basic introduction to the concepts of structured and unstructured data
- text-mining as a method of amplifying the structure in text data
- basic text-mining processes, including tokenising, standardising, tagging, and chunking
- a brief intro to the concepts of automatic classifiers and extraction.

**What you'll need**

- No prior knowedge, although it helps if you know a bit about using Python.
- If you want to follow along, open [these jupyter notebooks](mybinder.org/v2/gh/UKDataServiceOpen/text-mining/master?filepath=code) in a browser.
- Alternatively, download them and run the code locally if you prefer.
