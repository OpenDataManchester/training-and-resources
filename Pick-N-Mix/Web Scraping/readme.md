Vast swathes of our social interactions and personal behaviours are now conducted online and/or captured digitally. In addition to common sources such as social media/network platforms and text corpora, websites and online databases contain rich information of relevance to social science research. Thus, computational methods for collecting data from the web are an increasingly important component of a social scientistâ€™s toolkit.

This webinar delineates the value, logic and process of capturing data stored on websites. Presented by Dr Diarmuid McDonnell of the UK Data Service, this webinar will cover:

- the step-by-step process of collecting data from a web page,
- working through sample code written in Python,
- an end-to-end demonstration of how to apply web-scraping to the capture of real-time information on the Covid-19 pandemic, and
- a demonstration of how web-scraping can be used to further research on other topics, including charitable organisations.

What you'll need:
- Attendees may want to be familiar with/have installed Python, but this is not essential.
