In this session, we'll explore using R to process and visualise data, with specific focus on the tidyverse suite of tools, to make deprivation profiles from the Index of Multiple Deprivation data.

To follow along, you'll need to install R, Rstudio, and the tidyverse package. However, you'll also get a lot from watching the session.
