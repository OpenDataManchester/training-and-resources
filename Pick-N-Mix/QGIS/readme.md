QGIS is a free, open-source cross-platform geographic information system that lets you view, edit and analyse geospatial data.

In this session, we'll:
- begin to explore QGIS
- outline some key fundamentals of mapping
- demonstrate how to load in data and perform preliminary visual explorations
- create aesthetically beautiful (but accurate and useful) maps.

What you'll need:
- No prior experience with QGIS is required.
- If you would like to follow along with the demonstration, you can download the latest stable release of QGIS (version 3.10) directly from the website. It is completely free.
- Download QGIS: https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html
- Manchester trams data: https://github.com/langtonhugh/qgis_intro/blob/master/data/trams_geo.csv 

(To download tram data csv, click 'RAW'. This will show you a new page with the raw data. Then click 'File' -> Save Page As (or right-click -> Save Page As) to save the CSV to your computer)
