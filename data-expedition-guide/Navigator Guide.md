# Data Expedition Navigator Guide

Hello there!

You are taking on the role of an **Expedition Navigator.** It is a fun and exciting role, and this document aims to help you do your 
best.

**What is an Expedition Navigator?**
* The role of the Expedition Navigator is to lead your party, provide direction and seek help when necessary.
* You need to have an overview of the question that your team is trying to solve and make sure that the group doesn’t fall into 
any rabbit holes along the way.
* The Navigator also needs to be able to get the team through each point in the [Expedition Navigator Checklist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uGATeFJt7zBYjnHnAIHhMjCJrLa3DhNuiU3eii2k0p8/edit) in a timely manner.

**How does it work?**
Your group will work on a question that was formed at the questions workshop. Use the [checklist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uGATeFJt7zBYjnHnAIHhMjCJrLa3DhNuiU3eii2k0p8/edit) to make sure that you complete 
each task in order. It’s a good idea to familiarise yourself with the steps in advance of the data expedition.

   1) **Rendezvous** - go around the group, introduce yourself and briefly explain your competencies. The ‘Data Explorer’ exercise 
   will be useful for this, and it will help the group get a sense of each others abilities.
   
   2) **Mission Briefing** - You will need to explain the question to the group. Tell them why it was chosen, and why they will be working on it. Allow 20 minutes to do this. Try not to fall down any rabbit holes (1). If there is any difficulty or resistance from the group, advise them that it is better to start with this one, and then come back it to later on if there is still any problem with it.
   
   3) **Drawing a map** - Creating a map of the data you will need can help. Try this method: https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/mind-mapping
  
   4) **Scouting for data** - Try to find datasets relevant to your map. Ask the group if they know of any datasets or tools that can be used. Use the Wall Of Data (2) to find useful resources and share anything that your group finds.
   
   5) **Field Report** - You will report to other groups regularly what you have done so far, and see if they have ideas for datasets you can use or anything else that may be useful.
   
   6) **Task Allocation** - Once you have a sense of the initial work to be carried out, split the party into groups of two each with specific tasks to be carried out/data to be found. Make sure there’s a balance of skills.
   
   7) **Task Report** - Within your own party, report back any finding and progress.
   
   8) **Directional Decision** - Have the groups within your party decide if the data they have is useful in answering the your question. Clean, analyse and combine your datasets if you need to. If not, elect whether to find more details or refer back to the data pipeline (3) to decide what is best to do.
   
   9) **New Discoveries** - Reconvene as a party and decide how to present your findings. You may not have a complete answer to your group’s question. This is OK. The main thing is think about to present back the work you have done and what you have found so far.
   
   10) **Report Back** - All parties in the expedition report to each other what they have found throughout the day.

**Note on the checklist stages -** these stages are here to help guide your party during the expedition, but there will naturally be some deviation. Stay flexible, but be careful not to stray too far or fall down any rabbit holes!

___________________________________________


**What do you need to know?**
* Familiarise yourself with the question, and how it came about - particularly if you weren’t at the Questions workshop.
* You don’t need to have knowledge on the question topic, although that can be useful.
* Read and familiarise yourself with the Navigator checklist

**Who can help if you get lost?**
* We will check in regularly throughout the day as a whole group, so there will lots of opportunities to speak with other groups, get feedback and help.
* The Data Expedition facilitators are on hand to help you if you get really stuck!





-------------------------
(1) Used especially in the phrase “going down the rabbit hole” or “falling down the rabbit hole”, from ‘Alice in Wonderland’. This is a metaphor for something that transports someone into a wonderfully (or troublingly) surreal state or situation. In this instance, a rabbit hole refers to an extremely engrossing and time-consuming topic, but might ultimately be distracting or unuseful for the task in hand.

(2)  The Wall of Data is a list of all datasets and data portals found by all teams during the expedition and will be explained more on the day.

(3) The Data Pipeline is the main methodology taught and will be explained fully on the day.
