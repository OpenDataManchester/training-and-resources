# Data Expedition information for councils

A data expedition is a way of working with data from start to end. We use a modified version of the [School of Data 
data pipeline](https://schoolofdata.org/methodology/), which creates a narrative structure for the use of data. It identifies and builds upon individual 
skills and competencies, encourages team building and sets out a route that participants can follow to help identify 
and answer questions with data.

Data Expeditions consist of three workshops:
1. Questions workshop (½ day)
2. The main data expedition (1 day)
3. Storytelling workshop (½ day)

We begin in the Questions workshop by defining research questions that can be answered with data. These questions are 
then explored fully in the main Data Expedition. We then explore storytelling techniques to be able to take our 
findings and communicate them in a clear and compelling way.

Data expeditions bring together a diverse group of people from policy, community development and technical backgrounds 
in an action learning environment. Each expedition aims to explore themes and questions that are of interest to the 
council.

What the Data Expedition involves:
* It’s an Action Learning Set exercise to understand how to use data to solve problems 
https://www.bond.org.uk/resources/action-learning-sets
* It teaches a methodology and tools to use it.
* It includes hands-on work for all participants. 
* It is an opportunity to share your expertise and learn from the expertise of others.
* At the end of the process, you will get recommendations on how to work with data in the future and steps you can take.
* It is an opportunity to work in areas that you may not usually work in, and gives you a better picture of the whole 
process.
* It is fun but it will take you out of your comfort zone!

You don’t need to be a data analyst or expert. It’s not a hack day, and you won’t be expected to deliver a product. 
You won’t necessarily end the day with answers to your questions, but you will have learnt how to work and problem 
solve with data in new ways.

## About the workshop

### The Questions Workshop

The Questions workshop takes participants through a methodology to define research questions that:
1. Will be used to form teams and will be explored in the main data expedition. 
2. Explore particular themes or problems that are of interest to you and any stakeholders.
3. Can be answered by exploring data.

For the Questions workshop, we recommend no more than 10 participants. If you attend the Questions workshop, you 
are expected to be able to attend the main expedition. Participants in the Questions workshop will lead groups for 
the main expedition. 

__Requirements for the Questions workshop__
* A maximum of 10 participants. Participants should also be able to attend the main data expedition day.
* Spacious room with tables and space to move around.
* Wall space for post-it notes.
* Flipchart or whiteboard. 
* Refreshments and a break out area.

### The Data Expedition

The Data Expedition is the main workshop and the crux of the whole process. Participants form teams which then 
attempt to find as much data and information as possible which will help them answer the questions from the 
Questions workshop, and to explore them as much as possible. 

In this day-long workshop, people assess their skills and abilities and form teams where there is an even spread of 
skills, so that as the day progresses everyone has something to contribute and there is lots of opportunity to 
learn new skills from one another.

Data Expeditions can be quite an intense process and their success is determined by the commitment of the people in 
the room. It’s important the requirements laid out below are met to ensure the success of the day.

**Requirements for the Data Expedition**
* All participants are expected to have access to a device, preferably a laptop (some work laptops can have 
restricted access to the internet so check in advance and ideally bring your own device)
* If participants don’t have access to device, this needs to be flagged in advance so alternative provision can be 
arranged.
* Large space, with tables in cabaret-style, with plenty of space to move around. Ideally it will be a private 
space with plenty of natural light and ideally have a breakout area, with easy access to the outside if 
participants want a break.
* Fast and easy to access WiFi.
* Wall space and flipcharts for post-it notes.
* Projector/TV screen.
* Refreshments and lunch provided.

### About the Storytelling Workshop

During the Storytelling workshop, we will build compelling stories from the findings from the main data expedition 
day. We start by focusing on the audience and building up profiles, looking at the structure of stories and the 
dangers of misrepresenting data, before crafting a narrative that can help policy, create new partnerships and lead 
to positive change.

**Requirement for the Storytelling Workshop**

* Participants should have participated in the data expedition.
* Spacious room with tables, but space to move around.
* Wall space for post-it notes
* Flip-chart or whiteboard 
* Projector/TV screen
* Refreshments

#### Participants

* Should be a mixture of technical, policy and delivery.
* There should be external participants, ideally with a good mix of technical and data skills who can join teams.
* All levels of management are welcome, and will very much benefit from the process, but there needs to be 100% 
commitment from everyone for the whole day.

No one is expected to know everything about data. Whilst groups will be expected to present their work and findings 
from the day, they are not expected to have found answers or solved problems - the focus is on the process rather 
than the result.

#### What the process requires from you 

- To have an active role in the organisation and hosting of the workshops, including communication with all stakeholders and participants.
- Commitment from the start to attend all three workshops.
