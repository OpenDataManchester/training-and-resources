# Workshop methodologies for collecting and mapping data

## Indoor workshop methodology

Requirements:
* You need high-resolution map of the area you want to explore.
* You need a room with a table large enough to lay out the hi-res map.
* Somewhere to stick postit notes.
* Digital audio recorder - it's worth recording the workshop so you can clarify anything later on.
* You may want projector.
* You'll need to take into account the specific needs of your workshop participants by including them in the workshop prep and design.

1. Begin by generating a list of mobility and accessibility obstructions. Write these up on large post it notes and stick to the wall. 
2. Identify areas on the map where these obstructions can be found. Start to identify problem areas. Number these areas on the map. Write notes on postits with corresponding numbers.
3. Ask participants to describes regular routes, transcribing as above.
4. Any photographs taken also named with corresponding number of map point and postit notes. 

If you are running a series of indoor workshops, visit the identified areas taking photographs, videos and any other documentation. Bring these back to the workshops for clarification and to generate further discussion.
If you are also planning on outdoor expeditions, you may wish to take the routes identified.

## Outdoor expedition methodology

For the outdoor expeditions, it's good to have a sense of the routes you are going to take in advance. Try to go out in small groups, 1:1 if possible. We used digital dictaphones and asked participants to narrate their journey and experience as we went, asked questions for clarification and any other notes. 

Requirement:
* Digital audio recorder
* Camera
* Ideally nice weather!

1. Ideally go out 1:1.
2. Have a sense of the area or route you are going to explore in advance.
3. Allow for 1-2 hours, but this will depend on the person who is giving their time.
4. Using your digital audio recorder, ideally have the person narrate their journey and experience. You can record yourself, asking questions for clarificaiton where necessary.
5. Take photographs and videos of anything of note, which can be used as evidence later on or even uploaded as part of a map. If these can be geotagged, even better.
6. If you have smaller versions of your map, you could document direct onto this.
7. If you have access to GPS tracking device, you can record the route in real time. An app like myTracks allows you to record a route, mark points with notes and take photos, although it can take up a lot of battery power.

As for the indoor workshop above, you want to ensure all documentation is numbered and written up accordlingly.
