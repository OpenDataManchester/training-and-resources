# Mapping Mobilty Stockport Methodology

The following document will be useful to you if you are interested in finding out ways to map and document mobility and accessibility issues in urban areas.

**Note**: This methodology focuses on the generation/collection of data only, not the digitisation of the map data.

## Project Aim

The municipal environment often includes barriers that exclude people with restricted mobility. These barriers may be the result of natural topography, historic planning, deterioration of the urban environment or planned and unplanned maintenance. Some of the barriers may not be known to the local authority.

People with mobility impairments are on the frontline when it comes to negotiating these obstacles, and often have their own knowledge and strategies in negotiating and circumventing them. This is a resource that could be invaluable in helping others who face similar challenges, as well as helping local authorities identify where interventions need to be made.

‘Mapping Mobility Stockport’ aimed to create a mobility map of Stockport town centre by working with Disability Stockport and Age UK Stockport to crowdsource geospatial data for the areas that these communities regularly use, the routes they take to access these areas, and the obstacles and barriers that they come across, and the things that work well. 

As most of this information is tacitly contained within the communities themselves, there was a need to design a series of workshops which would help generate this data. The workshops and outdoor expeditions were co-designed with Disability Stockport and Age UK, and led by Open Data Manchester with Stockport Council. The information collected was fed directly back to Stockport Council, who would be responsible for the creation their own mobility map to be published onto the council website.

## Requirements
Open Data Manchester partnered with Stockport Council, who provided large print, high resolution maps of the town centre. We worked alongside Disability Stockport and Age UK Stockport. The entire project relied on their full participation.

For indoor workshops, we required suitable room, large table in the middle to lay out the map, ideally large-size post it notes and pens. Access to project for presenting any photographs etc was optional.

It's important to know in advance who will be attending and to cater for any needs they may have, particularly with regards to visual impairments. You might want to provide smaller sized handouts of the map for those who require it.

You want to carry out a mixture of indoor workshops and outdoor expedtions. It's the outdoor expeditions that generates the most data, but if for whatever reason outdoor expeditions are not possible, then the indoor workshops can potentially be used on their own (although this is not ideal).

## Workshop methodology 

The aim of these workshops was to introduce participants to the project, generate discussion and to begin to list and map mobility obstructions.

Post it notes were used to draw up a list of general and miscellanous things, such as 'tactile paving' or 'no controlled crossing'.

If these referred to a particular area or specific place on the map, then a number was added to both the map and the corresponding post it note.

This organically led to more detailed description of areas, such as the station or shopping centre. 

In between workshops, photographs were taken of these areas and the issues raised for confirmation and to generate further discussion.

In subsequent workshops you may want to focus on particular areas to get more detailed insight.

Specific areas and routes that are mapped in these sessions then provide stimulus for the outdoor expeditions. Or, if weather is not permitting, you can repeat the above steps.

Post each workshop, post-it notes were written up onto a sharable spreadsheet. [LINK TO OURS]. Any photgraphs taken between workshops were also numbered to match the post-it and mapping points.

## Expedition methodology

For the outdoor expeditions, it's good to have a sense of the routes you are going to take in advance. Try to go out in small groups, 1:1 if possible. We used digital dictaphones and asked participants to narrate their journey and experience as we went, asked questions for clarification and any other notes. 

* Ideally go out 1:1.
* Have a sense of the area or route you are going to explore in advance.
* Allow for 1-2 hours, but this will depend on the person who is giving their time.
* Digital audio recorder. Either have the person narrate the journey, or  record yourself, asking questions for clarificaiton where necessary.
* Take photographs and videos of anything of note, which can be used as evidence later on or even uploaded as part of a map. If these can be geotagged, even better.
* If you have access to GPS tracking device, you can record the route in real time. An app like myTracks allows you to record a route, mark points with notes and take photos, although it can take up a lot of battery power.

## Processing the data

- how stockport council used it
- OpenStreetMap tagging


Extensive photographs were also taken for documentation.

After each workshop, we then listened back to the audio and drew the routes and points onto the map, numbering points and items as per the indoor workshops. These were written up in the spreadsheet with corresponding photographs.
